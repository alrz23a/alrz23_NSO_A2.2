I've deployed a total of five servers using City Cloud. The BastionNSO host and HAProxy have floating IP addresses, while the development servers have only private IP addresses.

To deploy our Flask application on the development servers and set up load balancing, I am using the Ansible playbook site.yaml. This playbook handles both the application deployment and the configuration of HAProxy for load balancing.

For testing, I simply need to curl HAProxy's IP address, which should return the time and hostname of the server that responds.

Additionally, implemented UDP load balancing using Nginx
